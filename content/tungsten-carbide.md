description: Tungsten carbide (WC) is a chemical compound (a carbide) containing equal Tungsten and Carbon atoms often combined with a Nickel (Ni) or a Cobalt (Co) binder. Tungsten Carbide Metals are primarily produced using Powder Metallurgy and can be pressed and formed into shapes for use in industrial machinery, cutting tools, abrasives, ammunition, mining other tools, instruments, and jewellery.

Commonly workers in various industries (such as machining and carpentry), often refer to tungsten carbide just as carbide (without precise distinction from other carbides). Tungsten carbide is approximately double the density of steel hence it weighs twice as much (generally the most easy way to sort it).
