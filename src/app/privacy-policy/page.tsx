        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cookies and Tracking Technology:</strong>

        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that a website uses to recognize repeat
          users, track user behavior and target advertising and content. Cookies
          do not identify specific users, only a user&apos;s device. Like most
          websites, we may use cookies to store and track information about
          users of the Services. You may set your browser to notify you when you
          receive a new cookie or to disable cookies. However, this may hinder
          performance of the Services and prevent you from using some of the
          features of the Services.

          Other tracking technologies may record information such as Internet
          domain and host names, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
          software and operating system types, clickstream patterns, and dates
          and times the Services are accessed. We may link the information we
          record using tracking technologies to Personal Information we collect.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use Google Analytics to collect information regarding visitor
          behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to
          develop website content. For more information about Google Analytics,

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>
          We take the protection of your Personal Information seriously. We
          protect Personal Information against loss and theft as well as
          unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, and modification using
          security safeguards, including physical, organization and
          technological measures, commensurate with the sensitivity of your
          Personal Information. Employees who have access to your information
          are made aware of the importance of keeping it confidential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where we use service providers who might have access to your Personal
          Information, we require them to have privacy and security standards
          that are comparable to ours. We use contracts and other measures with
          our service providers to maintain the confidentiality and security of
          your Personal Information and to prevent it from being used for any
          other purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, since no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, we
          cannot guarantee the absolute security of the information stored. We
          also cannot guarantee that information you supply will not be
          intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          We retain Personal Information that we collect only as long as
          reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
          collected or to meet any applicable legal requirements.
        </p>

          password when you register for the Services. To the extent user IDs
          and passwords are utilized, you may not share your user ID and
          password with anyone else, and you are solely responsible for
